A Python-based trading bot for Solana memecoins that monitors live market data via the **Birdeye API**, identifies momentum-based entry signals, and executes trades through a **Phantom wallet** connection. Built with a full **paper trading simulation mode** to validate logic before any real capital is deployed.

---

## Features

- **Real-time price & volume monitoring** — pulls live data from Birdeye API across multiple Solana token pairs
- **Momentum signal detection** — triggers on configurable volume spike + price % change thresholds
- **Automated stop-loss & take-profit** — bot exits positions automatically to protect capital
- **Paper trading mode** — simulates full trade lifecycle with P&L tracking and zero real funds
- **Trade log** — every signal, entry, and exit is written to a structured CSV log
- **Wallet integration** — connects to Phantom wallet via Solana web3 for live execution (Phase 3)
- **Rug pull protections** — contract blocklist, max position size cap, and liquidity checks

## Tech Stack

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Python 3.10+ | Core language |
| `solana-py` | Solana blockchain interaction |
| `solders` | Solana transaction building |
| Birdeye API | Real-time Solana token price/volume data |
| Jupiter Aggregator API | Best-price swap routing |
| `pandas` | Trade log analysis |
| `logging` | Structured event logging |

## How It Works

```
Startup
  └── Connect to Solana RPC endpoint
  └── Load watchlist of token addresses
  └── Initialize paper trading ledger

Every 60 seconds
  └── Fetch price + volume for each token (Birdeye API)
  └── Check momentum signal:
      ├── Volume spike > 200% of 10-min average?
      └── Price change > +5% in last 5 minutes?
          └── NO  → continue watching
          └── YES → check rug pull filters
              ├── Token on blocklist? → SKIP
              ├── Liquidity < $10k?   → SKIP
              └── PASS → fire BUY signal
                  ├── [Paper mode] → log simulated buy, track P&L
                  └── [Live mode]  → route swap via Jupiter, sign with Phantom

Position monitoring (every 30 seconds)
  └── Price DOWN 25% → STOP LOSS  → sell
  └── Price UP 50%  → TAKE PROFIT → sell
```

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DSaint96/solana-memecoin-bot.git
cd solana-memecoin-bot
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure API keys
Create a `.env` file:
```
BIRDEYE_API_KEY=your_birdeye_api_key
SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=your_phantom_private_key
```

> ⚠️ **Never commit your `.env` file or private key to GitHub.** Add `.env` to your `.gitignore`.

### 4. Configure trading parameters
Edit `config.py`:
```python
PAPER_TRADING         = True   # Set False for live mode
MAX_POSITION_SIZE_USD = 5.00   # Max $ per trade
STOP_LOSS_PCT         = 0.25   # Exit if down 25%
TAKE_PROFIT_PCT       = 0.50   # Exit if up 50%
VOLUME_SPIKE_MULT     = 2.0    # Volume trigger multiplier
PRICE_CHANGE_MIN_PCT  = 5.0    # Min % move to trigger
```

### 5. Run the bot
```bash
python memecoin_bot.py
```

## Risk Controls

| Control | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Max position size | $5.00 | Caps loss per trade |
| Stop-loss | −25% | Auto-exits losing trades |
| Take-profit | +50% | Locks in gains |
| Liquidity check | > $10,000 | Filters low-liquidity tokens |
| Contract blocklist | Maintained manually | Blocks known scam tokens |
| Paper mode default | `True` | Prevents accidental live trades |
